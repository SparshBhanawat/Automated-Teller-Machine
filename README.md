Java ATM Project
This project is a simulation of an Automated Teller Machine (ATM) system implemented in Java. It provides basic banking functionalities such as:

Cash withdrawals
Deposits
Fund transfers
Balance inquiries
The project utilizes object-oriented principles to model different aspects of the ATM system, including bank accounts, transactions, and user interfaces. It demonstrates the use of Java classes, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism to achieve a modular and maintainable design.
